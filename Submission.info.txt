Ohmmeter displays, records, graphs and emails resistance measurements using a simple circuit connected through the iPod/iPhone/iPad headset port using a standard headset jack. The application is useful for measuring fixed resistance or recording resistance changes over a time period. Up to two days of resistance measurements can be recorded at rates of 10 samples per second. The measurements are graphed as recorded and can also be emailed in spreadsheet form.
